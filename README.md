# Calculator

## Introduction
This calculator is a simple web-based tool that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage operations.

## Features
- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Calculate percentages of numbers.
- Clear the input screen.
- Delete the last entered character.
- Display the result of calculations.

## Usage
### Input Screen
This is where the user inputs mathematical expressions and sees the result.

### Buttons
Press the buttons to input numbers, operators, or perform actions like clearing the screen.

#### Numeric Buttons
Input numbers from 0 to 9.

#### Operator Buttons
Use operators like +, -, ร, รท, and % 
And their combination.

#### Clear Button (AC)
Clears the input screen and resets the calculator.

#### Backspace Button (CE)
Deletes the last entered character.

#### Equals Button (=)
Computes the entered expression and displays the result.

## Implementation
### Frontend
The calculator is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### DOM Manipulation
JavaScript code interacts with the HTML document to handle user input and display output.

### Algorithm
The calculator uses the Shunting Yard algorithm to convert infix expressions to postfix notation for evaluation, ensuring correct operator precedence.

### Error Handling
The calculator handles invalid expressions gracefully and displays "Error" messages for incorrect input.

### Operator Precedence
The calculator follows the BODMAS rule for operator precedence:

1. Brackets
2. Orders (powers and roots)
3. Division and Multiplication (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

## Conclusion
This calculator provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic calculations with support for operator precedence and error handling. It aims to be intuitive and efficient for everyday mathematical tasks.
